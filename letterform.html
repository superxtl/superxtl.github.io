          <p>The LetterForm is an assignment that allows us to play around black and white spaces. First, I picked our favorite typography from any font websites. Then, I used illustrator to scale, rotate, and place them into a grid of white blocks. In order for the final product looking artistic, it was not desirable to showing the entire letterform, instead, I rotated and scaled to make sure only some of the characteristics of the letterform were shown in the grid. So, you would barely tell what letter it is.</p>
