It is an exercise particularly good for overweight people because there is less pressure on the knees. Bicycling particularly targets the Quadriceps which is the front muscle on the thigh. It is a muscle part that is relatively weak and always is omitted. Besides, bicycling is a good way to explore nearby. It is healthier than the car and faster than running.
