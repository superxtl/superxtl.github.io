          <p>Running is one of my favorite cardio exercises which enhances the heart, lungs, and lower body strength. Running can increase the whole bodyâ€™s blood flow, letting toxins leave the body faster. It is a natural remedy for headaches, mental-tiredness, depression, etc. Running can speed up the oxygen inhale and carbon-dioxide exhale, which makes the lung works more efficiently to prevent lung diseases. Running is a perfect training for lower body strength. It causes muscle damage to the leg and recovers through rest, which enables us to run longer and faster. You can perform running anywhere and anytime so it is really handy and easy to stick with your workout plan. It is good to run 30-50 minutes a day, 3-5 times a week to keep you energetic. But because running cause more muscle damage than any other cardio exercises, it takes longer time to recover especially for the beginners.</p>
