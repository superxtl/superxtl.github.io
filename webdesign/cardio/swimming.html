          <p>Swimming is a perfect way to improve oxygen utilization, whole-body strength, heart health, cold tolerance, and function of the nervous system and the immune system. Because of the pressure from the water, our lungs are stimulated for more efficient air exchange. Swimming can increase whole-body strength which keeps us in excellent shape. Swimming can increase heartbeat, which accelerates the function of the heart. Swimming in the cold water can calm down our nervous system, reducing inflammation. Besides, swimming can improve bad posture. Swimming is the best exercise for overweight people because there is no pressure on the joints. There are four types of strokes--crawl or freestyle stroke, the breaststroke, the backstroke, and the butterfly stroke. Each of them uses different body muscle but the overall benefit is the same. But because of the site restriction, swimming has less accessibility than other cardios.</p>
